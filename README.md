# Palindrome products
C++ program that given a random number  n > 0,  finds the palindrome numbers resulting from multiplying two numbers of n digits each. The program store these palindrome numbers in a text file using a different line for each product.

As input, the program will receive by command line the number n and the name of an output file to store the capicÃºa numbers, so that the program will be executed as:

$> ./palindrome_prod n output.txt

where n is the number of digits of the factors that produce the palindrome numbers.
